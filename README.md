# Manager-Tansferuri
C++ OOP


Description:
The program is based on a list of footballers, read from the file, characterized by their names, the team they play and their price on the transfer market, available for transfer. The manager (the user) receives from the club a certain budget (read from the keyboard) and, under certain conditions, may request additional funds (if he wants to buy a footballer that is more expensive than the allocated budget). Introducing the budget received from the club, the manager has the option to choose from the menu the option to buy footballers or to view the footballers you buy. The manager can buy existing players in the database and the transferred players are added to the transfer list.
